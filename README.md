## Features Voice Assistant for Drivers

### Voice Shortcut for Common Tasks

- **"Call Passenger"**: Activates phone mode for easy communication.
- **"Send message to [x]"**: Initiates message input, taking the next sentence as the content and prompting for confirmation when to end.
- **"Start navigation"**: Launches Google Maps for seamless route planning.
- **"Hi"**: Triggers a personalized greeting, addressing the user by name.
- **"I cannot find leh"**: The system will respond with the prompt, “Do you want to call the passenger?”
- **"What’s the weather in the next [x] hours?"**: Provides weather details for the specified time and location.

### Next-Passenger Mode

- The system will notify the driver with the voice prompt:  
  **"You have a new ride request from Jalan Ampang. ETA: 6 minutes. Do you want to accept?"**
  
- If the driver responds **"Yes"**, the AI confirms the request with:  
  **“Order confirmed; navigating now.”**

### Situational Awareness

- **Rerouting Function**:  
  If there is heavy traffic, the system will suggest,  
  **"Traffic ahead is slow, consider rerouting."**

- **Weather Awareness**:  
  If weather conditions change, the AI will notify the driver, such as,  
  **“It’s raining, drive cautiously.”**

- **Fatigue Awareness**:  
  The system will track driving time and alert the driver, for example:  
  **“You’ve been driving for 4 hours, take a break?”**

### Gesture Mode

- The driver can use gestures, such as coughing three times, to receive haptic feedback (vibration) instead of audible responses.
  
- For instance, if the driver coughs three times, the system will trigger a double vibration to initiate an emergency action, like calling the police, in situations such as a robbery.

### Voice Recognition

- During account setup, the driver is required to speak specific sentences to create a voice profile. This ensures that only the registered driver can interact with the AI.

- The system stores the driver’s accent in a database to enhance recognition accuracy.
